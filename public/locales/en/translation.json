These fundraisers are supporting initiatives on the ground that are related to medical needs, food distribution, delivery of home isolation kits among many others. We have tried to give a brief overview of each campaign. Please feel free to scroll through and support these fundraisers to the best of your ability. Every donation counts, every little effort adds up.",

So, countries like the US could really help fight this pandemic in Nepal by donating vaccines to the Government of Nepal. This will forestall immeasurable devastation for the people of Nepal. Please sign this petition organized by Nepal Rising to urge the US Department of State to support vaccine donations to Nepal.",

You can register for the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine for yourself or for others by filling out the application in the Ministry of Health and Population’s website linked below. The form can be filled either by an individual or by an organization for themselves or for others. The form is an important source of information for the government to assess the number of people willing to get vaccinated."
